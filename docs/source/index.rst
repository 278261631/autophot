Automated Photometry Of Transients Documentation
================================================

The *Automated Photometry Of Transients* (AutoPHoT) is a novel photometry pipeline, built from the ground up on Python 3 using packages from Astropy and Photutils.
|
The motivation for AutoPhoT aims to provide a precise method for photometric calibration. AutoPHoT is designed to accept *.fits* images, regardless of telescope and instrument. This documentation will provide several tutorials which will allow you to execute AutoPhOT on your own images as well as create your own databases for photometric corrections.
