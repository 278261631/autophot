Welcome to AutoPHoT!
====================

| The *Automated Photometry Of Transients* (AutoPHoT) is a novel photometry pipeline, built from the ground up on Python 3 using packages from Astropy and Photutils.

| The motivation for AutoPhoT is to provide a easy to use tool for photometric calibration.

| AutoPHoT is designed to accept *.fits* images, regardless of telescope and instrument.

| This documentation will provide several tutorials which will allow you to execute AutoPhOT on your own images as well as create your own databases for photometric corrections.

| If you encounter an issues using AutoPhOT, please open an issues `here <https://github.com/Astro-Sean/autophot/issues>`_.
